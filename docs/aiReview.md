## Functionality and correctness:
Overall the AI methods have the same functionality as my methods although there are differences here and there. 
The AI code is well written from an OO standpoint, getters and setters are correctly implemented, additionally member variables
are private. The naming convention is descriptive and relevant, and the simpler classes and methods are near identical
to my implementation. None of the methods implement a toString method, I failed to provide a request.I am concerned with the way 
the AI uses the indexs in the Board Class, specifically for the captureStones method, the AI maps the board 1-12, when the indexes are actually 0-11.
